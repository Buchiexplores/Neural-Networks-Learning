# Neural-Networks-Learning

In the previous exercise, feedforward propagation for neural networks was implemented and used to predict handwritten digits with the weights we provided. 
In this exercise, backpropagation algorithm to learn the parameters for the neural network was implemented.
"The provided script, ex4.m, will help you step through this exercise."
